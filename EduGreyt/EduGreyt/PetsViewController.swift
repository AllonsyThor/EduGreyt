Greyhounds, while larger dogs are great in apartments."], ["Question" : "Do they require a lot of exercise?", "Answer" : "Surprisingly, no. Most greyhounds will go on 3-4 20min walks per day and be just fine. They do enjoy long walks."], ["Question" : "Do greyhounds like children?", "Answer" : "As with all dogs, some enjoty children and others do not. Teaching a child the best way to interact with your hound will help. If you are expecting or plannign on expecting give your grey an adjustment period."]]
